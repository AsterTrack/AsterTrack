commit 3da8bd3

Modifications:
- Made use of custom expanded set of cursors (implemented in custom GLFW and modified GLFW backend for ImGui)
- (PlotDigital) Added x-axis shift support
- (PlotDigital) Fixed last item in a block of same digital value not showing (e.g. 1 and 2 items would both be of length 1)
- (PlotDigital) Fixed last item in buffer not showing at all
- (PlotDigital) Changed digital value modifying digital bar height to switching between bar colors as specified by ColorMap
    - BREAKING: Where you could previously specify the FillColor, now you have to set the value to an index into the ColorMap
    - BREAKING: Where 0 would previously show no bar, this is now delegated to NAN, and 0 shows a bar of ColorMap index 0
