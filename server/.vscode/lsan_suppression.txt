# Errors in libEGL, cannot fix
# GLFW correctly calls eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT/eglGetDisplay, which leaks 2688B in unknown module:
# Then eglInitialize leaks 128B, 144B, 40B, all despite eglTerminate being correctly called
# Both are in _glfwInitEGL, but names aren't reliable
leak:<unknown module>
leak:_glfwInitEGL
