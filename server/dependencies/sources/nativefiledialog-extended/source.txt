v1.2.1

Extracted relevant files
Changed include to "nfd.h" instead of <nfd.h> in nfd_glfw3.h
Changed declaration of nfdwindowhandle_t to give the previously anonymous struct a name:
    typedef struct nfdwindowhandle {...} nfdwindowhandle_t;
    This allows for forward declaration of nfdwindowhandle_t
