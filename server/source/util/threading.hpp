 * Custom thread wrapper
 * Combines automatic joining of std::jthread
 * With a way to signal the thread exited like std::async
 * While still leaving everything else bare and in control of the user
 * 
 * NOTE: Automatically set finished when exiting thread with:
 * const auto exitNotifier = sg::make_scope_guard([&]() noexcept { control.finished = true; });
 * NOTE: Pass control.stop_source.get_token() to thread
 * 
 * Not designed to need explicit synchronisation IF thread itself is handled on one main thread
 * Designed for threads that, throughout execution:
 * - have one explicit place to update state
 * - need to be interruptible
