# Shared Code for AsterTrack

## License
Most of the software and firmware in this repository is licensed under the LGPL v3, but parts of the codebase are licensed under the MIT license or the MPL 2.0. This can be determined on a file-by-file basis by looking at the file header.

The following merely describes the intent behind this seggregation: <br>
**MIT:**
In general, smaller, self-contained components and utilities that might be useful to other projects are licensed under the MIT license. <br>
**MPL 2.0:**
Some bigger algorithmic components are licensed under the MPL 2.0 with the intent that they can be repurposed with minor efforts for other projects. These files are not explicitly designed to be repurposed and some references to LGPL-licensed code might have to be removed. However, the author (Seneral) deemed those components potentially valuable to further open source development in other fields. <br>
**LGPL v3**:
The majority of the source code that is specific to AsterTrack or an optical tracking system just like it is licensed under the LGPL v3, with file-by-file exceptions as previously noted. <br>

If you wish to use a source code file in part or in full that currently is licensed too restrictively for you, feel free to contact me and I will consider changing the license of at least the source code over which I still hold copyright.
